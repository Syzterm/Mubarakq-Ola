                <h2>3: Spongebob Squarepants</h2>
                <p>SpongeBob is recognised by many as the greatest cartoon of all time. The show centered on a Sponge who lives under water in a pineapple
                    that no one knows how it came abou. The show is a lot of fun and it has won several awards back to back for many years. It's subsequent consistency
                    is one of the things that makes it stand out and its storyline alongside spongbob bizzar adventures that don't even make any sense also contributes to its greatness.

                <h2>1: Ben 10</h2>
                <p>It started when an alien device did what it did. From the lyrics the into to the stroyline, this show is a 
                    super sky rocket masterpiece. In an era when cartoons had the same ideas and average storylines, ben 10 came in. Not only the kingdoms
                    but the adults were also moved from their seats. There's no other cartoon that gives such versitility about other alien life forms.
                    the show and 3 incredible sequels showing evolution of the human and alien age and dawn. As time passed time passed it was clear and obvious
                    that there was no greater joy than watching ben 10 in the cartoon industry. His watch is called omnitrix, with its powers and his good heart he proved
                    time and time again that he's truly the ultimate,the cartoon omnipotent and the baddest kid to ever save the day.
